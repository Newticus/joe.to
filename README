plugin.yml defines the plugin, for bukkit

J2Plug* classes are functions, separated by category
J2Plr* classes are related to player actions
J2Block* classes are related to block actions including players placing blocks

There is a file of code from hmod that hasn't been transitioned as it isn't supported in bukkit anyway.



You need bukkit (not craftbukkit) and on your build path,
and you need the mysql connector bin.

Go to a build of Bukkit-main
