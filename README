plugin.yml defines the plugin, for bukkit

J2Plug* classes are functions, separated by category
J2Plr* classes are related to player actions
J2Block* classes are related to block actions including players placing blocks

There is a file of code from hmod that hasn't been transitioned as it isn't supported in bukkit anyway.



You need bukkit (not craftbukkit) and pircbot on your build path. 

Latest bukkit at: http://bamboo.lukegb.com/
Go to a build of Bukkit-main, such as BUKKIT-BUKKITMAIN-58
Under the artifacts tab, download the .jar file

For pircbot: http://www.jibble.org/files/pircbot-1.5.0.zip
